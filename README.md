# Advent of Code

---

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code, organized by year.

I make no guarantees to the quality nor completeness of my solutions.
I would like to think that I improve from year to year...

## Yearly Breakdown

I usually quit after a certain point due to general year-end business.
