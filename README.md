# Advent of Code

---

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code, organized by year.

I make no guarantees to the quality nor completeness of my solutions.
I would like to think that I improve from year to year...

## Yearly Breakdown

I usually quit after a certain point due to general year-end business.

| **Year** 	| **Progress** 	| **Languages**   	|
|----------	|--------------	|-----------------	|
| 2022     	| 9/31         	| Racket          	|
| 2023     	| 5/31         	| Racket, Haskell 	|
| 2024     	| In progress  	| Racket, Python, ...     	|

## Running my code

Save your inputs to a directory as `.txt` files.

I usually don't include main functions in my solutions. 
There are different methods for each language.

Racket: Get answers with DrRacket's built-in REPL.

Python: Run the script in interactive mode (`$ python -i dayN.txt`).
I also recommend using Jupyter Notebooks.
